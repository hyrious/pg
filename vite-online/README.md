# vite online

If we can move vite on a static front-end page...

## Todo

- `<textarea>` based editor, because codemirror 6 is not stable
- design a HMR strategy --  
  we can have two pages, one editor, one preview  
  communicate with each other through channels  
  also we can make use of workers
- load esm modules through Object URL
- load libraies on the fly -- through jsdelivr, in fact
